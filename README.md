# Introduction to APIs Workshop

This is starter code for a beginners-friendly introduction to APIs workshop. This project was created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The goal of the workshop is to use an API to generate random quotes.

## Getting Started

In the project directory:
1. Download and install [node](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Open `Terminal` on MacOS or `PowerShell` on Windows
3. Clone this git repository by running `git clone https://github.com/hootsuite/apis-101.git` then `cd apis-101`. 
If you don't have git installed or encounter other issues, you should be able to download [a zipfile of the code directly](https://github.com/hootsuite/apis-101/archive/master.zip)
4. Run `npm install` which will download all dependencies for this project
5. Run `npm start` which will start the project

## Workshop

Follow the instructions in [src/Quotes.js](https://github.com/hootsuite/apis-101/blob/master/src/Quotes.js) to make the 'Generate Quotes' button work!

### Solutions

You can view solutions by switching branches on GitHub to either `solution`, `solution-include-author` or `solution-quotes-by-author`. Do this by clicking the button that reads `Branch: master`.
